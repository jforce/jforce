Hi! I'm James, a consultant at Red Hat with a passion for cloud technologies and infrastructure. My expertise these days namely spans around Linux, Kubernetes, Istio, Ansible and Ceph, however, being versatile is fun and I would never limit myself to specific technologies.

I am a strong advocate of [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source), the [UNIX philosophy](https://cscie2x.dce.harvard.edu/hw/ch01s06.html), and the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)!
