Hi! I'm James, a consultant at Red Hat with a passion for cloud technologies and infrastructure. My work namely focuses on designing and building large-scale, mission-critical platforms. I specialize in a wide range of technologies, including Linux, Kubernetes, Istio, Ceph, and Ansible. 

I am a strong advocate of [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source), the [UNIX philosophy](https://cscie2x.dce.harvard.edu/hw/ch01s06.html), and the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)!
